# Spark and Vector usage

This is a collection of Zeppelin Notebooks to illustrate how to use Apache Spark and the Actian Spark Vector Connector to load and manipulate data.

These Notebooks require installation of Apache Spark CSV and Spark-Vector connector JAR files into your Spark and Zeppelin environment. If not using Spark packages, just drop the JAR files into Zeppelin's interpreter/dep directory.

To use these, start your Zeppelin instance and from the main Zeppelin landing page, simply choose 'Import note' then choose one of the .json files in this package. The supporting text files are in this package too.
